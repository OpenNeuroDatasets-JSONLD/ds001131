Task:
This dataset contains of 18 subjects passively listening to an audio
Story1 (“MilkyWay”) and 18 subjects passively listening to an audio
Story2 (“Vodka”). Each subject has one functional run of 297 TRs, during which s/he heard an audio story (“Milky Way” or “Vodka”), while viewing a gray screen. Subjects were instructed to attend to the details of the
narrative.

Image acquisition:
All imaging data were acquired using a 3T Siemens Skyra MRI scanner
with a 16-channel head coil. Functional images were obtained with a
T2*-weighted EPI sequence: TR=1500ms, TE=28ms, FOV=192mm, flip
angle=64, thickness=4mm (3x3x4mm voxels). 27 oblique axial slices
aligned to the anterior/posterior-commissure line were collected in
interleaved order. To align scans high-resolution MPRAGE T1-weighted
anatomical images were collected.

File descriptions:
* There are 18 subjects that listened to Story1 (18 nifti files, “subj1” to “subj18”)and 18 subjects that listened to Story2 (18 nifti files, “subj19” to “subj36”).
* Story1 audio file (“milky.aiff”) and Story2 audio file (“Vodka.aiff”)
* Story1 text (“MilkyWayNew.doc”) and Story2 text (“vodkaNew.doc”)

The scan included: 18 seconds of music, 3 seconds of silence, and then
the story started. At the end of the story there were 15 seconds of
silence.
As the TR was 1.5 seconds, the story actually started at TR=15, and
ended at TR=283. This is true for all the subjects, except Subj18 and Subj27 who started at TR=11 and ended at TR=279 (due to trigger issues in the scanner).
